## What is this about?
This was the project that I made along with other students for the *DevFest Hackathon* organised by [**GDG-SBA**](https://www.instagram.com/gdg.sba/), on January 6th 2023.
> The mystery word for this year's edition was "Time", learn more about what that is from [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cmzf-rHI44M/).
